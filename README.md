One Step DQN Asyncronous Implementation
=

This repo contains a one step deep Q-learning asyncronous implementation and code base for future research in asyncronous multi-agent implementation of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The key features of this implementation is:
* The use of multiprocessing (indeed threading module) for real advantage of multi-core processors. 
* Use keras hight level features with minimum backend exposition. But it yet depends of tensorflow backend.
* Many examples of other approaches of implementation (in progress).
* Research purprose this code make it instable by nature.  It is good, because each new change is exposit in new file (no branch need, only new files are created).
* Caotic organization of code (organization in progress).

The code available contains differents experiments and idea exploration in level of test of prove.
